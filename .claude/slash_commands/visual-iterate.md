description: Visual-driven development - implement design, screenshot, iterate until match
---

Follow this visual-driven development workflow:

1. **Use the visual mock I provide** - I'll give you either:
   - An image file path to read
   - A pasted/dropped image
   - Access to take screenshots (via Puppeteer MCP, iOS simulator MCP, or I'll manually provide them)

2. **Implement the design in code** based on the visual mock.

3. **Take a screenshot of your implementation** and compare it to the target mock.

4. **Iterate on the code** - adjust your implementation, take new screenshots, and keep refining until the result matches the mock.

5. **Commit the code** when I'm satisfied with the visual match.

Use the visual mock as your target for iterative improvement - implement, screenshot, compare, adjust, repeat until success.
